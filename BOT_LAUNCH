This will be quick and is written for someone who has already done this at least once.
Edit: This was only tested on astra bots (black ones )

1) Plug in the bot to the laptop, turn the laptop on, turn on bot.

2) Record bot IP using ifconfig.

3) //this step isn't necessary for this project

4) Check the ~/.bashrc files of the bot. they should have the following:

TURTLEBOT bashrc:
export ROS_HOSTNAME=IP_OF_TURTLEBOT
export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://IP_OF_TURTLEBOT:11311
export TURTLEBOT_3D_SENSOR=astra

5) source ~/.bashrc if you changed them

6) On the two terminals, run the following

$ roslaunch turtlebot_bringup minimal.launch --screen
